## :sparkles: Learning Swift FP approach together with pointfree.co :sparkles:

Here I will track all my activities for such themes I have chosed.
And the first one is **The Case for Case Paths**. You can see below what I've already closed.

### The Plan

- [x] [Episode 87](https://www.pointfree.co/episodes/ep87-the-case-for-case-paths-introduction): The Case for Case Paths: Introduction
- [x] [Exercises | Episode 87](https://www.pointfree.co/episodes/ep87-the-case-for-case-paths-introduction#exercises)
- [ ] [Episode 88](https://www.pointfree.co/episodes/ep88-the-case-for-case-paths-properties): The Case for Case Paths: Properties
- [ ] [Exercises | Episode 88](https://www.pointfree.co/episodes/ep88-the-case-for-case-paths-properties#exercises)
- [ ] [Episode 89](https://www.pointfree.co/episodes/ep89-case-paths-for-free): Case Paths for Free 
- [ ] [Exercises | Episode 89](https://www.pointfree.co/episodes/ep89-case-paths-for-free#exercises)

UPD #1: I have finished the only first four exercises from the episode 87. Before start the exercise #5 need to dive into operators in Swift. More details in [Sundell's article](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/articles/custom-operators-in-swift/).

### What inspires me 

I have followed my GitHub recommendations as usual and see a [such repo](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-case-paths) from the pointfree team.
I thought I could find a time and some space for myself to tinker with my current Swift knowleadges.
It should be interesting to dive into such more-less functional stuff in **my** daily language.
